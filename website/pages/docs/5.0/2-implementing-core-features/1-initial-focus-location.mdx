#### Initial focus location

The focused location isn't set up by default. You can enable it by setting the `initialFocusLocation` property in the `ReactGrid` component.

Example:

```tsx
<ReactGrid
  cells={cells}
  rows={rows}
  columns={columns}
  initialFocusLocation={{ rowIndex: 2, colIndex: 1 }}
/>
```

**Note:** The focused cell is entirely controlled by the browser's focus mechanism, which means it can easily be set programmatically. The recommended approach for doing this is by using the `setFocusedCell` method from the [useReactGridAPI](/docs/5.0/6-api/2-hooks/1-usereactgridapi) hook.

Alternatively, you can directly invoke the `.focus()` method. Example:

```ts
document.querySelector("rgHiddenFocusTarget rgFocusRowIdx-3 rgFocusColIdx-3").focus();
```
