 * This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space.

 * @param aX - The x-coordinate of the first point.
 * @param aY - The y-coordinate of the first point.
 * @param bX - The x-coordinate of the second point.
 * @param bY - The y-coordinate of the second point.
 * @returns The Euclidean distance between the two points.
