#### About ReactGrig embedding, virtual scrolling and sticky panes pinning

`ReactGrid` component isn't limited by height and width so its behaviour can change a little bit depending on its scrollable parent element.

ReactGrid appends scroll event to its immediate scrollable parent and lets itself expand to full height/width with the option of
constant observation of available viewport size.

Limiting the size of `ReactGrid` can be achieved by adding CSS class listed below 
(bear in mind that the total rows height must be bigger than scrollable element height)

```css
.reactgrid-wrapper {
    height: 100px;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```

Multiple nested scrollable elements can cause unexpected experience like incorrect cell editor position, wrong focus location etc.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout color="info">
	If all rows/columns can't be rendered in viewport - virtual scrolling still works fine.
</Callout>

#### Example: ReactGrid component limited by the height of its parent

import LiveCode from "@/nextra/components/LiveCode.tsx";
import { ReactGrid, Column, Row } from "@silevis/reactgrid-4";
import "@silevis/reactgrid-4/styles.css";
import {LimitedHeightByParentSample} from "../../content/samplesSrc/limitedHeightByParentSample/LimitedHeightByParentSample.v4"
import {NotLimitedHeightByParentSample} from "../../content/samplesSrc/notLimitedHeightByParentSample/NotLimitedHeightByParentSample.v4"

<LiveCode
scope={{ReactGrid, LimitedHeightByParentSample}}
code={`
const App = () => <LimitedHeightByParentSample/>
render(<App/>)
`}
/>


In this case, not all the passed rows can be rendered, so scrollbar appears and sticky pane is pinned directly to the top of the 
parent element. 

#### Example: ReactGrid component NOT limited by the height of its parent

<LiveCode
scope={{ReactGrid, NotLimitedHeightByParentSample}}
code={`
const App = () => <NotLimitedHeightByParentSample/>
render(<App/>)
`}
/>

 

ReactGrid renders all the passed rows and columns if sticky panes are passed - they are pinned directly to the edge 
of `body` element.
