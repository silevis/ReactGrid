## useCellContext
The `useCellContext` hook provides access to the context of a specific cell within the ReactGrid component. This hook is essential for obtaining detailed information about a cell's position, selection state, focus state, and styling. It allows you to interact with and manipulate individual cells programmatically.

```ts
import { useCellContext } from '@silevis/reactgrid'

const ctx = useCellContext();
```
